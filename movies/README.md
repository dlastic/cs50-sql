# Movies – CS50 SQL Problem Set

This folder contains my solutions for the **Movies** problem set from CS50’s week on SQL.  
The database contains information about movies, people (actors, directors), and ratings, and is based on data from IMDb.  
A detailed description of the problem can be found at [CS50 Movies Problem Set](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/psets/7/movies/), together with the `movies.db` file.  
Each `.sql` file corresponds to a specific task from the assignment, where the goal is to write SQL queries to answer questions about this database of movies.
