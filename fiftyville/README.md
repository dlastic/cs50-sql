# Fiftyville – CS50 SQL Problem Set

This folder contains my solution for the **Fiftyville** problem set from CS50’s week on SQL.  
The goal is to use the provided `fiftyville.db` to identify the thief, the city they escaped to, and their accomplice after the duck was stolen on **July 28, 2024** on **Humphrey Street**.  
A detailed description of the problem can be found at [CS50 Fiftyville Problem Set](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/psets/7/fiftyville/), together with the `fiftyville.db` file.
