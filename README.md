# CS50 SQL Problem Sets

This repository contains my solutions for CS50’s SQL assignments.

## Movies

Queries on `movies.db` (IMDb-based dataset) to answer various questions about movies, people, and ratings.  
Each `.sql` file corresponds to a specific task from the assignment.

## Fiftyville

Investigates a fictional theft using SQL queries on `fiftyville.db` to find:

- The thief
- The city they escaped to
- The accomplice

Files:

- `log.sql` – all queries with comments
- `answers.txt` – final answers
